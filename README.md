# Predicting-Bee-Species-from-Images-using-Naive-Methods
Bee identification from images is a challenging task, yet it has significant implications for researchers who rely on field data collection. Can a machine accurately identify the species of a bee from an image? In this project, we aim to answer this question by utilizing the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. Our goal is to build a model that can effectively distinguish between honey bees and bumble bees based on an image of these insects. This project is part of a series that focuses on working with image data, developing classifiers using traditional methods, and utilizing deep learning techniques for computer vision.

# Libraries

First, we need to import the Python libraries with which we will work.

Import the class Image from the library PIL.
Import the function train_test_split from the model_selection module of sklearn.
Import the function SVC from the svm module of sklearn. This is the model we'll use.
Import the function accuracy_score from the metrics module of sklearn. This is the metric we'll use.
